2. Describe the sequence data you plan to use by specifying:
I have below described one dataset that currently is my candidate for the dataset I wish to analyse for the course. I do, however, have a couple of other options. I have a very large dataset of exercise recordings from thousands of members of a gym with classification of activities and dureation. I am not sure how appropriate this data will be for sequence analysis. The other dataset is indeed the most interesting but we have just negotiated access so I have yet to receive it. This dataset has extensive data on Sony Ericsson platform innovation. Yet a possibility will be a large data set on mobile app store downlads over time. I am still considering what my best option will be, but as a backup, I have for now chosen the dataset described below of 37,000 SAP support tickets.
* What the sequences are representing and where they come from.Sequence of 37k+ SAP support incidents reported and resolved. The incidents are opened between April 1st 2007 and April 1st 2009.
* Whether there is one sequence per case or multichannel sequences? In case of multichannel sequences, specify to the following points for each channel.
One sequence pr incident. The icident is logged and reported resolved when so* The nature of the sequences (Categorical? Chronological? State or event sequences? ...,)
Chronological sequence of:
* Time-stamped recording time
* Time-stamed closing time
* Reported location
* First and last name of contact
* Support person opening case
* Support person closing incident
* Primary team number
* Product type from which incident occurs
* Priority code
* Descrioption of incident
* Description of resolution

* The alphabet (list of symbols in the sequences).– Is there a natural order of the symbols (ordinal variable)?* Size of the alphabet– If larger than 15, propose category mergings to reduce the size.– In case of numerical sequences, suggest a way to discretize the values into 15 classes or less.* Number of sequences.* Maximum and minimum sequence lengths.* The kind of knowledge you expect to extract from your sequences. What are you primarily interested in: sequencing, timing, duration, quantum?

This is at this point fairly explorative and I will for confidentiality reasins not be able to publish the dataset. I can anonymise a small subset of the data and publish for illustrative purposes.
I hope to learn something on the work surrounding the organisational adaptation of a complex IT artifact by studying the type and variation of support requests over a period of time.
