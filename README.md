SACC - Sequence Analysis Course Code
====================================
__What the sequences are representing and where they come from__
* Sequences represent venture creation / business start-up process
* Sequences are sourced from 3 panel studies of nascent entrepreneurship (PSED I / PSED II / CAUSEE)
* Entrepreneurs are captured in the process of starting their new venture (but prior to being successful / unsuccessful) and tracked over a number of years.
* Initial data capture asks about the start-up process to data so contains some retrospection bias (depending on the stage of development at recruitment)
* Follow-up data (annually) is less prone to retrospection issues.

**Whether there is one sequence per case or multichannel sequences?**
**In case of multichannel sequences, specify to the following points for each channel**
* Yet to determine how to handle this best - there are simultaneous events - so could be considered multi-channel.
* Currently the data has been treated as single channel & coded for 'simultaneous events'

**The nature of the sequences (Categorical? Chronological? State or event sequences? ...,)**
* Event sequences: The sequences data is generated from timed event data for 30+ venture creation activities (coded into 2 or 4 activity categories)
* Temporal resolution is to the month (however some cases cannot recall exact month and may have quarterly / yearly estimates)

**The alphabet (list of symbols in the sequences)**
* Using two different coding schemes: 1) Discovery/Exploitation & 2) Organizational Emergence
* Discovery/Exploitation alphabet is: Disc (Discovery) / Expl (Exploitation) / DiEx (Simultaneous Discovery-Exploitation)
* Organizational Emergence alphabet is: I (Intention) / B (Boundary) / R (Resources) / E (Exchange)


**Is there a natural order of the symbols (ordinal variable)?**
* There is normative order to both of these sequence schema
* Discovery/Exploitation goes: Disc - (DiEx) - Expl
* Organizational emergence goes: I - B / R - E

**Size of the alphabet**
* Discovery/Exploitation: 3
* Organizational emergence: 4

**Number of sequences**
* max N (CAUSEE) = 625 (or less depending on how many years data is used)
* PSED samples N > 1000

**Maximum and minimum sequence lengths**
* min L = 1
* max L = ~30

**The kind of knowledge you expect to extract from your sequences**
**What are you primarily interested in: sequencing, timing, duration, quantum?**
* Am interested in most characteristics of the sequences (sequencing, timing, duration, quantum, entropy / turbulance)
* Primary aim is to assess whether venture creation sequences encode the eventual viability of the start-up attempt
* Currently looking at order/sequencing for Discovery/Exploitation
* Would like to examine duration / timing information for Organizational emergence
