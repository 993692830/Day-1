SACC - Sequence Analysis Course Code
====================================
__What the sequences are representing and where they come from__
* Sequences represent venture creation / business start-up process
* Sequences are sourced from 3 panel studies of nascent entrepreneurship
* Entrepreneurs are captured in the process of starting their new venture (but prior to being successful / unsuccessful) and tracked over a number of years.
* Initial data capture asks about the start-up process to data so contains some retrospection bias (depending on the stage of development at recruitment)
* Follow-up data (annually) is less prone to retrospection issues.

**Whether there is one sequence per case or multichannel sequences?**
**In case of multichannel sequences, specify to the following points for each channel**
* Yet to determine how to handle this best - there are simultaneous events - so could be considered multi-channel.
* Currently the data has been treated as single channel & coded for 'simultaneous events'

**The nature of the sequences (Categorical? Chronological? State or event sequences? ...,)**
* Event sequences: The sequences data is generated from timed event data for 30+ venture creation activities
* Temporal resolution is to the month (however some cases cannot recall exact month and may have quarterly / yearly estimates)

**The alphabet (list of symbols in the sequences)**
* Using two different coding schemes: 2 & 4 Element Alphabets


**Is there a natural order of the symbols (ordinal variable)?**
* There is normative order to both of these sequence schema

**Number of sequences**
* max N = 500+

**Maximum and minimum sequence lengths**
* min L = 5
* max L = 30+

**The kind of knowledge you expect to extract from your sequences**
**What are you primarily interested in: sequencing, timing, duration, quantum?**
* Am interested in most characteristics of the sequences (sequencing, timing, duration, quantum, entropy / turbulance)
* Primary aim is to assess whether sequences encode the eventual viability of the start-up attempt
